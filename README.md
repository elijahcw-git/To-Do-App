## Summary

A so-called "right of passage" for new software developers is to create the ever-famous to-do list. This project intentionally avoided significant styling efforts. The to-do list includes vanilla Javascript, and HTML/CSS. In Javascript, several DOM manipulations were used in order to provide functionality, and to provide more practice during the SDMM program. Some challenges during this development process included properly addressing attributes of specific DOM elements, and using the correct selector criteria.
